# Axum example for authentication with Google oauth

This repository contains a minimally changed example to official Discord oauth example to make it work with Google's oauth instead.

There just a few changes needed, thanks to the OIDC standard and the pretty clean example code.

The main changes is tracked in commit [e461341](https://github.com/strekmann/axum-example-oauth-google/commit/e461341e0c9f56b13a46be06a0e08158c5dc8c23) and the full example is in [main.rs](https://github.com/strekmann/axum-example-oauth-google/blob/main/src/main.rs), which also contains usage documentation at the top.
